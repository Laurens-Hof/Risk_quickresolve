# A Risk quickresolve script

You know how games of Risk can take forever, especially late-game when you spend 15 minutes rolling dice to resolve *one* battle? This R program can resolve large Risk battles in no time at all, and is exactly what you need in such a case!

...or maybe not, since it's probably too much hassle to break out some random script in the middle of your game. At least it allows me to show off that I know how recursion works :). This was one of my first projects in R, and I felt really clever once I had figured it out.

I have two versions of the script: one basic one, and one with support for the "airfield" feature in some versions of the game. This allows the player controlling that tile to roll an extra die.

In the script called "simulation" you can simulate the process a large number of times, in case you want to know what your odds are for a given fight.
