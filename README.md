# A Risk quickresolve script

You know how games of Risk can take forever, especially late-game when you spend 15 minutes rolling dice to resolve *one* battle? This R program can resolve large Risk battles in no time at all, and is exactly what you need in such a case!

...or maybe not, since it's probably too much hassle to break out some random script in the middle of your game. At least it allows me to show off that I know how recursion works :). This was one of my first projects in R, and I felt really clever once I had figured it out.
